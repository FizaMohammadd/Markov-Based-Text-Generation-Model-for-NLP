# 🧠 Markov-Based-Text-Generation-Model-for-NLP

This project implements a **probabilistic text generation model** using a **Markov chain approach** in Python. It trains on any input text and generates new, coherent sequences based on learned word transitions.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Markov Chain–based probabilistic model
- ✅ Custom tokenization of input text
- ✅ JSON-based model persistence (save & load trained models)
- ✅ Coherent text sequence generation
- ✅ Fully implemented in Python (no external ML libraries)

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Tokenization**  
   Input text is split into tokens (words or characters) to build the transition probabilities.

2. **Model Training**  
   The Markov chain is trained by analyzing the frequency of token sequences (n-grams).

3. **Text Generation**  
   Starting from a random or specified token, the model predicts the next token based on learned probabilities.

4. **Model Persistence**  
   Trained models can be saved and loaded using JSON for reusability across sessions.

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- No external dependencies (uses built-in libraries like `json` and `random`)
